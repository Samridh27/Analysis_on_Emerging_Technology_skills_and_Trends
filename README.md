# Analysis on Emerging Technology Skills and Trends

## üìä Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive data analysis effort aimed at identifying and analyzing the most sought-after skills and key trends in emerging technologies within the job market. By collecting, cleaning, and visualizing job posting data, this study provides insights into what skills are most valued and how the technological landscape is evolving.

The analysis follows a typical Data Science lifecycle, starting from data collection and ending with visualization and conclusions presented in the Capstone Presentation.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that document each stage of the analysis, along with the final presentation file.

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `DATA COLLECTION.ipynb` | Processes for gathering the raw data from various sources. |
| `Collecting_Jobs_data_Using_API-Questions.ipynb` | Specific notebook detailing the methodology for collecting job data using external APIs. |
| `Accessing_APIs_review_lab.ipynb` | Lab or practice notebook for API access techniques. |
| `Web-Scraping-Lab.ipynb` | Lab or practice notebook for web scraping techniques to gather supplementary data. |
| `DATA WRANGLING.ipynb` | Cleaning, structuring, and transforming the raw data into a usable format for analysis. |
| `EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS.ipynb` | Initial investigation of the cleaned data, including statistical summaries and feature distribution. |
| `DATA VISUALIZATION.ipynb` | Creation of charts, graphs, and visual dashboards to highlight key findings and trends. |
| `Capstone Presentation.pdf` | The final presentation summarizing the methodology, findings, and conclusions of the entire project. |

## üíª Technologies and Tools

The analysis is primarily conducted using Python and its scientific libraries within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

* **Language:** Python
* **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Data Collection:** `requests` (for API), BeautifulSoup or Scrapy (for Web Scraping)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly (depending on what was used in the notebooks)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## üöÄ Getting Started

To replicate this analysis or run the notebooks locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You need Python installed, along with the required libraries. A virtual environment is recommended.

```bash
